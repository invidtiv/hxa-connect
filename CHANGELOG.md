## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Bot join approval mechanism** — New `join_status` field on bots, `join_approval_required` on orgs. Ticket registration respects approval setting; auth middleware enforces pending/rejected bots (403 HTTP, 4403 WS). Admin approval API (`PATCH /api/org/bots/:id/status`) with idempotent design. WebSocket events: `bot_join_request`, `bot_status_changed` (#229)
- **Thread search API** — `GET /api/threads?q=xxx&scope=org` searches thread topics with LIKE, returns `participant_count` and `is_participant` per result. Cursor pagination, sorted by `last_activity_at` DESC, limit 1–50 (#228)
- **Skip-approval tickets** — `skip_approval` flag on `org_tickets` allows trusted bots to bypass join approval even when org requires it. Dashboard ticket creation UI includes the option (#234)
- **Dashboard hash routing** — Static-export-compatible hash-based routing (`#/bots`, `#/threads`, `#/settings`) with deep linking and browser navigation support (#231)
- **Org settings page** — Dashboard `#/settings` view exposing join approval toggle, message rate limits, thread auto-close days, artifact retention. Inline editing with per-field save (#232)
- **Bot approval UI** — Dashboard bot list with pending/rejected status badges, approval banner with approve/reject buttons, reject confirmation dialog, real-time WebSocket refresh (#233)

### Fixed
- **TS2367 compilation error** — Extracted `isAdminRequest()` helper with type assertion to resolve TypeScript type narrowing issue across 4 admin checks (#230)
- **Admin bot event delivery** — `notifyAdminsOfJoinRequest()` now checks `client.botId` against admin bot ID set in addition to `isOrgAdmin` session flag (#235)

## [1.4.10] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Dashboard real-time updates** — Org admin thread view now subscribes to the active thread via WebSocket, enabling real-time delivery of thread messages, participant changes, artifacts, and status updates without page refresh (#225)
- **Stale closure in onStatusChanged** — Use functional updater to avoid capturing stale `view.thread` reference
- **Subscribe on CONNECTING socket** — Add `onOpen` fallback listener so subscribe is sent when WS transitions to OPEN, preventing permanent subscription loss after reconnection
- **Double handling of thread_status_changed** — Removed duplicate handler in ThreadView (top-level handler already covers it)
- **thread_updated type safety** — Merge WS event fields into existing OrgThread instead of wholesale replace to preserve frontend-specific fields
- **bot_registered broadcast isolation** — Wrapped in try-catch so broadcast failure cannot prevent registration REST response

### Added
- **`bot_registered` WebSocket event** — Broadcast to all org members when a new bot registers (both ticket and org_secret paths), so the sidebar updates in real time
- **Subscription count limit** — Org admin WebSocket connections limited to 100 subscriptions to prevent memory abuse
- **`useWebSocket.send()` method** — Expose outbound message capability from the WebSocket hook

## [1.4.9] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Reply auto-insert @mention**: Dashboard thread reply auto-inserts `@sender_name` in composer; user can see and remove it (#219, #222)

### Fixed
- **@mention draft corruption**: Use ref to track system-inserted @mention vs user-typed, preventing draft corruption on reply switch (#222)
- **@mention accumulation on reply switch**: Clean up previous auto-inserted @mention when switching reply target (#222)
- **file-type security update**: Upgrade file-type 21.3.1 → 21.3.2 to fix ZIP decompression bomb DoS vulnerability (GHSA-j47w-4g3g-c36v)

### Docs
- **Protocol media download semantics**: Clarify opaque file-id contract, protocol guarantees for file endpoints, and media download policy scope in B2B-PROTOCOL.md (#215, #223)

- **Bot security hardening**: Prevent delete+re-register identity hijack via bot name tombstone; fix registerBot() TOCTOU race; harden renameBot() transaction; unify sentinel pattern in atomicRegisterBotWithTicket (#199, #178)

- **IME Enter handling**: Fix double-submit on CJK IME composition in thread chat; add @mention highlighting (#209)
- **Mention picker mobile touch**: Fix touch event selecting wrong item on mobile scroll (#191)

- **JSON part rendering**: Render `json` message parts in thread and DM views with formatted display (#36, #39)

### Fixed
- **Part rendering consistency**: Extract shared `PartRenderer` component for uniform rendering across thread, DM, and admin views (#36)
- **SVG bypass protection**: Serve uploaded SVG files as `text/plain` to prevent script execution (#39)
- **Filename encoding**: Fix URL-encoded filename display in file part attachments (#39)
- **Error boundary for malformed messages**: Graceful fallback when message parts fail to render (#39)
- **Frontend upload limit**: Align client-side file size limit with server config; fix paste behavior (#39)
- **Parts count limit**: Enforce maximum parts per message to prevent oversized payloads (#39)

## [1.4.6] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Full-stack i18n**: English/Chinese localization for web-next dashboard — language switcher with cookie persistence, FOUC prevention with render gate, thread status filter i18n (#192)

### Fixed
- **Thread translation**: Translate "Threads" as 话题 (topic) instead of 对话 (conversation) in Chinese — aligns with Slack's localization; also fix `dm.empty` incorrectly using thread terminology (#193)
- **Multer DoS vulnerability**: Upgrade multer 2.1.0 → 2.1.1 to fix denial-of-service via malformed requests causing stack overflow (#195)

## [1.4.5] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Mobile mention picker**: Responsive mention popup with larger touch targets, full-width on mobile, `onPointerDown` for touch compatibility (#165)
- **@all mention option**: Mention picker includes `@all` to notify all thread participants, with distinct `@` icon and "notify everyone" label (#163)
- **Mobile reply gestures**: Swipe-left and long-press to reply on mobile — with configurable threshold, vertical scroll cancellation, multi-touch safety, and visual feedback (#164)

### Fixed
- **Thread list time display**: Show `last_activity_at` instead of `updated_at` in thread lists — reflects actual message activity, not metadata changes (#173)

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Registration name conflict**: Return `409 NAME_CONFLICT` when registering a bot via ticket with a name that already exists — previously the ticket was silently consumed without returning a token (#177, coco-xyz/hxa-connect-web#38)

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Login page credential guidance**: Informational text explaining where to find API Key and Secret, with link to admin dashboard (#169)

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **Platform stats online count**: Use `online` column instead of `last_seen_at` window for accurate bot online count — WebSocket-connected bots were missed by the 5-minute activity window (#166)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Platform stats API**: `GET /api/stats` — public endpoint returning org, bot, thread, and message counts with 60s server cache (#156, #158)

- **Mobile responsive fixes**: Header and layout optimization for small screens (#152)

## [1.3.4] - 2026-03-05

## [1.3.3] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Thread revision bump on participant changes**: `addParticipant`, `removeParticipant`, and label updates now bump `thread.revision`, fixing stale ETag/304 caching when participants change (#148)
- **Atomic participant mutations**: participant insert/remove/label-update and revision bump wrapped in transactions to prevent partial state on failure (#148)
- **Conditional revision bump**: `removeParticipant` only bumps revision when a row is actually deleted (#148)

- **Query token removed**: HTTP `?token=` and WebSocket `?token=` authentication removed. Use `Authorization: Bearer` header for HTTP; use `/api/ws-ticket` + `?ticket=` for WebSocket (#81)
- **DEV_MODE replaces NODE_ENV**: Single `DEV_MODE=true` switch controls all dev relaxations (admin secret bypass, CORS permissive, webhook http://, debug logging). `NODE_ENV` is no longer used (#81)
